# OpenTelemetry local collector

This is a placeholder for OpenTelemetry collector 
to check configuration and consistency of the traces, metrics, and logs coming out of the app,
without complex setup of OpenTelemetry collector in the local environment. 
The placeholder just displays the data in console, and doesn't store this information anywhere else.

Please note that this placeholder must not be used in production. 
Instead, the app should be configured to point an instance of production OpenTelemetry collector that is covered separately.
